# Remote profile

## Problem

Users want their desktop client to be in sync with profiles at their main device (presumably a mobile phone).
Due to distributed nature of SimpleX chat and comprehensive encryption it is difficult to maintain up to date multi-way synchronized presentation between devices.

## Solution

A typical (and expected) solution for this is running a server on a master device which will handle all the communication.
Then, additional "thin" client(s) would be able to present an interface, delegating everything else to the main.

Fortunately, we already have such a protocol in our clients.
CLI and GUI run a text+json RPC protocol to their chat core.
CLI has a WebSocket server for it that facilitates making custom clients and bots â€“ it won't be usable here though.

We can run this protocol over a secure channel designed specifically for this problem.

Then we can tweak clients to use this protocol instead of regular "local" profiles.

## Session lifecycle

For the sake of grounding and familiarity the roles are:
* "Mobile": a master device which stores data and does the communication.
* "Desktop": UI client attached to the master.

1. Discovery: a user wants to attach a desktop client to their mobile.
2. Handshake: desktop and mobile establish a secure duplex session.
3. Activity: desktop sends requests and receives events from mobile and updates its presentation.
4. Restart: desktop should be able to re-eastablish channel unattended in the case of network winking out for a while.
5. Disposal: mobile can terminate the link and permanently dispose the established session.

### Discovery

The expected flow is desktop initiates the discovery by generating OOB key data and shows a QR code for mobile to scan.
The mobile then scans that QR code, decodes the "attachment request" and spins up a network server.

There is a problem here, that the desktop doesn't know where its mobile actually located.

This can be solved in a few different ways:

1. The desktop starts a server and encodes its local IP in the QR. Mobile then connects to it.
2. The desktop encodes its local IP, but mobile only does a minimal client legwork, only to signal its actual location. Then the sides flip.
  * The legwork may entail sending UDP datagram to desktop IP with an IP of its own.
  * Another option is to use a TCP "nanoprotocol" of sending a `host:port` line.
3. The mobile may start announcing itself with UDP broadcasts for the duration of the phase (bluetooth-style) using information in the QR code.
4. A desktop may create a temporary SMP queue and show its address. The mobile then submits its server data to it.

Another option is to run the server on desktop and have mobile discover it with the help of QR code to get server identity and keys and then on the network via some protocol. Using a fixed address is suboptimal as most networks have dynamic IPs.

### Handshake

The aim of this phase is to establish a TLS+cryptobox session.

TLS could be complex as we need to generate self-signed certificates on desktop (if it acts like a server). A plaintext ws connection with cryptobox encryption could be sufficient initially?

TBD

### Activity

The desktop starts its chat core with a special parameter to signal that it should be using the session instead of its regular "local" database. This can be determined per user profile.

Other than that, the client behaves like it would do with a local chat state.
Its chat core being handed a socket uses it to relay the chat protocol data.

The mobile, starts replaying the commands it had received on its state, maintaining a single point of truth.
When a mobile receives events or replies, it mirrors them to the attached session.

Only a subset of the chat API should be available this way.
Requests like `/_stop` or `/_db delete` should be filtered out and ignored.

Some of the relayed commands (e.g. `/_read chat` or `/_reaction`) the mobile should apply to its own state too.

A simpler solution could be that while desktop client is connected mobile UI is locked. When the session terminates, mobile UI gets unlocked and refreshed.

> A tweak in protocol that would reply with an event like "accepted read of X up to Y" may remove the need for such matching and interpretation.

### Restart

It would be annoying to users if walking to another room and loosing WiFi connection for a few seconds would result in another QR dance.

Therefore, the non-ephemeral part of handshake material should be reused for reconnects.

TBD

### Disposal

The session may have a lifetime that a desktop or a mobile may stipulate while preparing a session.
Alternatively a mobile (or a desktop, why not) may signal that they're done here and no further activity should be going with the session parameters.

## Caveats

A public WiFi spot (or a specially configured home AP) may prohibit clients to connect with each other, denying them link-local connection.
n such an event, an alternative transports may be considered:
- Bluetooth link.
- USB tethering that presents an ethernet device.
- The usual NAT traversal techniques.
- Running localnet-providing VPNs.
- Routing chat traffic via SMP queues.

Application chat traffic may end up too chatty for the link.
This may result in large power drain for both sides or unpleasant latency.
Compression protocols may be used to mitigate this.
Since we know that chat API is text+JSON Zstd compression with pre-shared dictionary may provide huge traffic savings with minimal CPU effort.

## "Should-works"

File transfer appears to be running within the chat protocol.

UI assumes that files are available in a local storage, the access to files is not part of chat RPC. This complicates things a lot.

Attaching multiple sessions appears to be realistic without extensive modifications.

A headless client with a global address (e.g. VPN or TOR) may be used in a manner of IRC bouncers.

This may also allow "thin" mobile clients (cf. traffic concerns) and browser apps.

A backup system may be implemented by attaching a headless app to a bouncer as one of the sessions.

## Unresolved questions

- What to do with WebRTC/calls?
- Do we want attaching only to a subset of profiles?
- Do we want a client to mix remote and local profiles?
- Do we want M-to-N sessions? (follows naturally from the previous two)
